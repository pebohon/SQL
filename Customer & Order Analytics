#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(distinct orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(distinct orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
and product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers as cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
on cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
where length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select distinct product, min(price)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product, price
order by price asc
limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select product, sum (quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many 
SELECT sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average am
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
